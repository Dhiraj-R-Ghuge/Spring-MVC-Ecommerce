🛒 E-Commerce Backend Application (Java Spring Boot)
📖 Overview

This project is a backend-only e-commerce web application developed using Java Spring Boot.
It demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, Spring MVC architecture, DTOs (Data Transfer Objects), and RESTful APIs for handling e-commerce operations like product management, user management, and order processing.

The PostgreSQL database is used for data persistence, and all API testing has been performed using Postman.
The frontend UI was created with the help of AI tools, but all backend logic, architecture, and database integration were designed and implemented by me.
